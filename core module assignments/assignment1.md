ðŸ’¡ **Q.1** `<!DOCTYPE html>` is not a tag in HTML. It is a document type declaration (DTD) and is used to specify the version of HTML or XHTML that the document is written in. It informs the web browser about the document type being used, which helps the browser render the content correctly. In HTML5, the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is used to indicate that the document is written in HTML5.

ðŸ’¡ **Q.2** Semantic tags in HTML are specific HTML elements that carry meaning and describe the structure and content of the web page. They provide a more meaningful and understandable representation of the content to both developers and search engines. Some examples of semantic tags are `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, etc.

The need for semantic tags:
- Improved accessibility: Semantic tags help screen readers and assistive technologies understand the content better, making it more accessible to users with disabilities.
- Better SEO: Search engines can better understand the content and its structure, which can lead to better search engine rankings.
- Clearer code: Semantic tags make the HTML code more descriptive and self-explanatory, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain.

ðŸ’¡ **Q.3** The main difference between HTML tags and elements is that:
- Tags: Tags are the markup components used in HTML to define the structure and appearance of the content. They consist of an opening tag `<tagname>` and a closing tag `</tagname>`, surrounding the content they apply to. Tags are not visible in the rendered output.
- Elements: Elements are the combination of the opening tag, closing tag, and the content they enclose. The entire structure, including tags and content, is known as an element. Elements are visible in the rendered output.

For example:
```html
<p>This is a paragraph element with a <a href="#">link</a>.</p>
```
In this example, `<p>` and `</p>` are tags, and the entire `<p>` element, including the opening tag, content, and closing tag, is the element.

ðŸ’¡ **Q.4** Here's a basic example of building a simple resume using HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Your Name - Resume</title>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Your Name</h1>
    <p>Email: your.email@example.com</p>
    <p>Phone: (123) 456-7890</p>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Write a brief summary about yourself and your career objectives.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>University Name - Degree Name - Year of Graduation</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <p>Job Title - Company Name - Duration</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Responsibility 1</li>
        <li>Responsibility 2</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Skill 1</li>
        <li>Skill 2</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  </main>
  <footer>
    <p>References available upon request</p>
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
```


ðŸ’¡ **Q.6** Some advantages of HTML5 over its previous versions are:
- Improved semantic elements: HTML5 introduced new semantic elements (like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, etc.) that provide a clearer structure and meaning to the content, making it more accessible and SEO-friendly.
- Multimedia support: HTML5 introduced native support for audio and video elements, eliminating the need for third-party plugins like Flash.
- Canvas and SVG: HTML5 introduced the `<canvas>` element for drawing graphics and animations, and the `<svg>` element for scalable vector graphics, allowing for richer and interactive visual content.
- Form enhancements: HTML5 added new form input types (e.g., email, date, range) and attributes, making it easier to create user-friendly and mobile-friendly forms.
- Offline storage: HTML5 introduced the `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` APIs, enabling web applications to store data locally on the client-side, even when offline.
- Geolocation: HTML5 added support for accessing the user's geolocation through the Geolocation API, allowing web applications to provide location-based services.
- WebSockets: HTML5 introduced WebSockets, enabling real-time communication between the browser and the server, facilitating interactive and dynamic web applications.

ðŸ’¡ **Q.7** Creating a full-fledged music player would require more than just HTML. It would involve JavaScript for handling playback and controls, CSS for styling, and possibly server-side code for handling audio files. Below is a basic HTML structure for a simple music player:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Simple Music Player</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Simple Music Player</h1>
  <audio controls>
    <source src="path/to/your-audio-file.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
  </audio>
</body>
</html>
```

ðŸ’¡ **Q.8** The `<figure>` tag and `<img>` tag are both used to display images, but they have different purposes:

- `<img>` tag: The `<img>` tag is a self-closing tag used to embed images in an HTML document. It requires the `src` attribute to specify the image file's source and the `alt` attribute to provide alternative text for accessibility.

- `<figure>` tag: The `<figure>` tag is a semantic tag used to mark up a self-contained content, such as an image, diagram, illustration, etc. It is often used in combination with the `<figcaption>` tag to provide a caption for the content.

Here's an example of how they can be used together:

```html
<figure>
  <img src="path/to/your-image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
  <figcaption>Caption for the image</figcaption>
</figure>
```

ðŸ’¡ **Q.9** The main difference between HTML tags and attributes is:

- HTML Tags: HTML tags are used to define the structure and presentation of the content. They enclose and define the elements on a web page. Tags are written as opening and closing pairs (e.g., `<tagname>` and `</tagname>`).

- Attributes: HTML attributes are used to provide additional information or modify the behavior of HTML elements. They are added to the opening tag of an element and are written as `attributeName="value"`.

Example of a tag with an attribute:
```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Click here</a>
```

In this example, the `<a>` tag is used to create a link, and the `href` attribute is used to specify the URL that the link points to.

Some examples of global attributes in HTML are `class`, `id`, `style`, `title`, `lang`, `data-*`, etc. These attributes can be applied to any HTML element and have a common meaning across elements.
